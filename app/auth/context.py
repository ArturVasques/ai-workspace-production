"""
Trusted identity and authorization context.

AppContext is created by the application after authentication and is passed
to agents and tools as trusted runtime context.

The LLM never chooses user_id, tenant_id or permissions.

Used by:
- authentication layer to represent the authenticated caller.
- Agents SDK Runner as execution context.
- tools to enforce user and tenant boundaries.
