"""
Uniform HTTP error handling.

Domain ValueErrors raised by services (e.g. ingestion_service rejecting an
empty document) become a consistent 400 JSON body instead of an unhandled
500 with a leaked traceback. An AssistantContractError from the assistant
output contract becomes a 502 instead of a stack trace. Every other
unexpected exception is logged with structlog and returns a generic body
that never leaks internals to the client.

AssistantContractError (not TypeError) is registered deliberately: mapping
every TypeError app-wide to "the assistant returned an unexpected response"
would misclassify an unrelated bug elsewhere in the request path (e.g. a
wrong-arity call in a repository) as an AI upstream failure, actively
misleading incident triage. Only the one narrow, intentional failure mode
in agent_service.py should ever produce a 502 here; any other TypeError
falls through to handle_unexpected_error's masked 500, which is correct.

A handler registered for the exact `Exception` class (the masked-500
fallback below) is special-cased by Starlette into ServerErrorMiddleware,
which wraps the entire middleware stack including app/core/middleware.py's
request_id_middleware. That means the response it produces never passes
back through request_id_middleware's own header-setting code, so every
handler here reads the request id from request.state directly (set by
request_id_middleware before call_next) and attaches it itself, instead of
relying on the middleware to do it on the way out.

Used by:
- main.py to register exception handlers.
